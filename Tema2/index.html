            Wait a minute, I said I wanted simple, but not boring. What is up with this design? There's nothing on it but white space and some text and a minimal picture. That's not what I had in mind. The type is all in Helvetica, which I like, but it doesn't excite me at all. There is just no character to anything here. It has a minimal look, but it's just  too vanilla. I reallu need something to grab the attention of a visitor to the site and this just doesn't do it.
